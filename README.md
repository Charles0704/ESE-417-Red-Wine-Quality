This repo contains the Python code, project report, and data set used for ESE 417 Final Project. 
The classes are on a scale of 3-8, 3 being bad wine and 8 being good wine. 
The data set contains eleven features and 1599 different labeled red wines. 
The data set is imbalanced.

We used an Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networ (ANN), and Support vector machine (SVM) models to train and test. 
We first initially did some data preprocessing and visualization, then trained the models to get a general sense of preformace. Then used gridsearch to tune the hyperparameters of each model. 
After this, we implemented each model with the most optimial parameters and evaluated the preformance using accuracy and precision preformance metrics.
