## Background
This repo contains the Python code, project report, and data set used for ESE 417 Final Project. 
The dataset contains eleven features and 1599 different labeled red wines.
The classes are on a scale of 3-8 where 3 being bad wine and 8 being good wine. 

We used an **Random Forest(RF)**, **Artificial Neural Networ(ANN)**, and **Support vector machine(SVM)** models to to classify and predict the rating level of wine. 
We first initially did some data preprocessing and visualization, then trained the models to get a general sense of preformace. Then we use Gridsearch to tune the hyperparameters of each model. 
After this, we implemented each model with the most optimial parameters and evaluated the preformance using accuracy and precision preformance metrics.
